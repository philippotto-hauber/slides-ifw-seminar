  abstract={We propose a new approach to sample unobserved states conditional on available data in (conditionally) linear unobserved component models when some of the observations are missing. The approach is based on the precision matrix of the states and model variables, which is sparse and banded in many economic applications and allows for efficient sampling. The existing literature on precision-based sampling is focused on complete-data applications, whereas the proposed samplers in this paper provide draws for states and missing observations by using permutations of the precision matrix. The approaches can be easily integrated into Bayesian estimation procedures like the Gibbs sampler. By allowing for incomplete data sets, the proposed sampler expands the range of potential applications for precision-based samplers in practice. We derive the sampler for a factor model, although it can be applied to a wider range of empirical macroeconomic models. In an empirical application, we estimate international factors in GDP growth in a large unbalanced data set of about 180 countries.},

  abstract = {This paper constructs hybrid forecasts that combine forecasts from vector autoregressive (VAR) model(s) with both short- and long-term expectations from surveys. Specifically, we use the relative entropy to tilt one-step-ahead and long-horizon VAR forecasts to match the nowcasts and long-horizon forecasts from the Survey of Professional Forecasters. We consider a variety of VAR models, ranging from simple fixed-parameter to time-varying parameters. The results across models indicate meaningful gains in multi-horizon forecast accuracy relative to model forecasts that do not incorporate long-term survey conditions. Accuracy improvements are achieved for a range of variables, including those that are not tilted directly but are affected through spillover effects from tilted variables. The accuracy gains for hybrid inflation forecasts from simple VARs are substantial, statistically significant, and competitive to time-varying VARs, univariate benchmarks, and survey forecasts. We view our proposal as an indirect approach to accommodating structural change and moving end points.}

  abstract = {We incorporate external information extracted from the European Central Bank’s Survey of Professional Forecasters into the predictions of a Bayesian VAR using entropic tilting and soft conditioning. The resulting conditional forecasts significantly improve the plain BVAR point and density forecasts. Importantly, we do not restrict the forecasts at a specific quarterly horizon but their possible paths over several horizons jointly since the survey information comes in the form of one- and two-year-ahead expectations. As well as improving the accuracy of the variable that we target, the spillover effects on “other-than-targeted” variables are relevant in size and are statistically significant. We document that the baseline BVAR exhibits an upward bias for GDP growth after the financial crisis, and our results provide evidence that survey forecasts can help mitigate the effects of structural breaks on the forecasting performance of a popular macroeconometric model.}

The algorithm is based on Kalman filtering methods and is computationally viable for large models that can be cast in a linear state space representation. We build large vector autoregressions (VARs) and a large dynamic factor model (DFM) for a quarterly data set of 26 euro area macroeconomic and financial indicators. The two approaches deliver similar forecasts and scenario assessments. In addition, conditional forecasts shed light on the stability of the dynamic relationships in the euro area during the recent episodes of financial turmoil, and indicate that only a small number of sources drive the bulk of the fluctuations in the euro area economy.},

  abstract = {Summary Many forecasts are conditional in nature. For example, a number of central banks routinely report forecasts conditional on particular paths of policy instruments. Even though conditional forecasting is common, there has been little work on methods for evaluating conditional forecasts. This paper provides analytical, Monte Carlo and empirical evidence on tests of predictive ability for conditional forecasts from estimated models. In the empirical analysis, we examine conditional forecasts obtained with a VAR in the variables included in the DSGE model of Smets and Wouters (American Economic Review 2007; 97: 586–606). Throughout the analysis, we focus on tests of bias, efficiency and equal accuracy applied to conditional forecasts from VAR models. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

We explain how to use DSGE models for all three purposes – forecasting, story-telling, and policy experiments – and review their forecasting record. We also provide our own real-time assessment of the forecasting performance of the Smets and Wouters (2007) model data up to 2011, compare it with Blue Chip and Greenbook forecasts, and show how it changes as we augment the standard set of observables with external information from surveys (nowcasts, interest rates, and long-run inflation and output growth expectations). We explore methods of generating forecasts in the presence of a zero-lower-bound constraint on nominal interest rates and conditional on counterfactual interest rate paths. Finally, we perform a post-mortem of DSGE model forecasts of the Great Recession, and show that forecasts from a version of the Smets–Wouters model augmented by financial frictions and with interest rate spreads as an observable compare well with Blue Chip forecasts.}
